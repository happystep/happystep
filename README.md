# Hi there 👋

I’m Luis — a Data Platform Engineer focused on building modern, cloud-native data platforms.

I work at Plub designing ingestion frameworks, orchestration workflows, and AWS Lakehouse components (S3, Glue, Athena, Lake Formation). My interests sit at the intersection of **data engineering, cloud infrastructure, and data architecture**.

### What I’m working on
- Building and evolving resilient data platform foundations  
- Implementing Infrastructure as Code for reproducible data environments  
- Improving data governance, metadata, lineage, and quality frameworks  
- Learning more about architecture, orchestration, and modern data stack tools  

### What I enjoy
- Cloud-native engineering (AWS)  
- Automation + CI/CD  
- Designing systems that make analytics faster, simpler, and more reliable
